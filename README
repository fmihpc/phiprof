Phiprof a simple library that can be used to profile parallel MPI
programs developed at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. It can be
used to produce a hierarchical report of time (average, max, min)
spent in different timer regions. A log format can also be written,
where the performance as a function of time may be reported.


Features
  * Supports C++ and C (C programs have to be linked with a C++ compiler)
  * Low overhead (Less than 1 us)
  * Can print the total time as a human-readable hierarchical report
  * Can print the evolution of time metrics in a easy-to-parse format to track how the performance develops over time
  * Automatically handles cases where groups of processes execute different codepaths
  * (Cray specific) All timer regions are also defined as Craypat regions if Craypat module is loaded

Not supported
  * No Fortran interface
  * Phiprof is not threadsafe, it should only be called by the master thread, or outside of threaded regions.
  * Phiprof does not automatically add regions, these have to be added manually into the code.


INSTALLATION

Enter phiprof/src folder
edit Makefile 
make
Install lib and .h files from phiprof/lib and phiprof/include into suitable location 

USAGE
