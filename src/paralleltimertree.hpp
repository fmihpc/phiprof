    * Print the  current timer state in a human readable file
    *
    * This function will print the timer statistics in a text based
    * hierarchical form into file(s), each unique set of hierarchical
    * profiles (labels, hierarchy, workunits) will be written out to a
    * separate file. This function will print the times since the
    * ininitalization of phiprof in the first start call. It can be
    * called multiple times, and will not close currently active
    * timers. The time spent in active timers uptill the print call is
    * taken into account, and the time spent in the print function will
    * be corrected for in them.
    *
    *
    * @param comm
    *   Communicator for processes that print their profile.
    * @param fileNamePrefix
    *   (optional) Default value is "profile"
    *   The first part of the filename where the profile is printed. Each
    *   unique set of timers (label, hierarchy, workunits) will be
    *   assigned a unique hash number and the profile will be written
    *   out into a file called fileprefix_hash.txt
    * @param minFraction
    *   (optional) Default value is to print all timers
    *   minFraction can be used to filter the timers being printed so
    *   that only the ones with a meaningfull amount of time are
    *   printed. Only timers with (timer time)/(total time)>=minFraction
    *   are printed. If minfraction is <=0.0 then all timers are printed.
    * @return
    *   Returns true if pofile printed successfully.
